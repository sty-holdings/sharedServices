# Reusable Constants and Variables

## constantsTypesVars is the lowest level package for STY-Holdings.

## Restrictions:
constantsTypesVars can not call out to any other package because it may create a circular reference.
This means that code can be duplicated in the package that also resides in another package.

No code is allowed in this package.

### Here is a link to the article about why this exists: [The overlooked area of coding](https://medium.com/@scott28479/the-overlooked-area-of-coding-b2c25579ca0f)

This is meant to be where everyone can share Constants and Variables, primarily static values. Also, there can be helper functions with the constants and variables.

If you don't like the coding style used for the file, there is no such thing as the right way to code. You should be flexible.
